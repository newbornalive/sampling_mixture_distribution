How can I sample from a mixture distribution, and in particular a mixture of Normal distributions in R? 
For example, if I wanted to sample from:

0.3×N(0,1)+0.5×N(10,1)+0.2×N(3,.1)

In general, one of the easiest ways to sample from a mixture distribution is the following:

Algorithm Steps

1) Generate a random variable U∼Uniform(0,1)

2) If U∈[∑ki=1pk,∑k+1i=1pk+1)
interval, where pk correspond to the the probability of the kth component of the mixture model, then generate from thedistribution of the kth

component

3) Repeat steps 1) and 2) until you have the desired amount of samples from the mixture distribution
